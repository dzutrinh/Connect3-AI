## Connect3 - AI
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game between Human and Computer. Simply an illustration of the MiniMax algorithm. It's just for fun during the pandemic.

## Compiling
* GCC: just type 'make'
* Turbo C 2.01: 'make -fmakefile.tcc'
* Borland C++ 3.1: 'make -fmakefile.bcc' 
* Open Watcom: 'make -fmakefile.wcc'

## Supports
- DJGPP (MS-DOS)
- Turbo C 2.01 (MS-DOS)
- Borland C++ 3.1 (MS-DOS)
- Open Watcom 1.9 (MS-DOS)
- GCC (macOS Big Sur)

So many DOS-based C compilers were tested, well I have a lot of spare time atm, not sure if it work on the others :P
